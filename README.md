### Exploring-NYC-school-Test-Results


Every year, high school students across the U.S. take the SAT ‚Äî a standardized test assessing literacy, numeracy, and writing proficiency. With each section (Reading, Math, Writing) scored out of 800, SAT scores play a vital role in shaping students‚Äô college admission prospects.

This project analyzes SAT performance across New York City (NYC) public high schools to uncover meaningful patterns that can guide decision-making for policymakers, researchers, and parents.

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

The dataset `schools.csv` contains SAT performance data for NYC public high schools. Each row represents one school, along with its location and average SAT scores.

| Column Name       | Description                                                                 |

| `school_name`     | Name of the public high school                                              |
| `borough`         | One of NYC‚Äôs five boroughs (e.g., Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn, etc.)         |
| `building_code`   | Unique code identifying the school building                                 |
| `average_math`    | Average Math SAT score (out of 800)                                         |
| `average_reading` | Average Reading SAT score (out of 800)                                      |

## ‚ùì Questions Explored

1. **Which NYC schools have the best math results?**  
   Identified top schools based on average Math SAT scores.

2. **What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?**  
   Calculated total score by summing the average scores from Math, Reading, and Writing sections.

3. **Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?**  
   Measured borough-wise variability to determine disparities in school performance.
